        <h2>Our Journey</h2>
        <p>Bethesda Ministry began in 1998 with a small but passionate group of believers meeting in a humble gathering space. What started as a local worship initiative quickly grew into a thriving faith community, embracing people from all walks of life. Through prayer, music, and unwavering faith, we expanded beyond our initial vision.</p>
        <p>Over the years, Bethesda Ministry became a beacon of hope, offering not only worship services but also community outreach, mentorship programs, and artistic faith expressions. Our focus has always been on creating a space where everyone feels welcome and spiritually empowered.</p>
        <p>In the early 2000s, we launched our worship team, which traveled across the country sharing gospel music and spreading joy through song. With the rise of digital platforms, Bethesda Ministry embraced new ways to connect with believers globally, fostering a strong online presence that continues to grow.</p>
        <p>Today, we stand as a modern faith-driven movement, combining tradition with innovation to touch lives worldwide. Whether through heartfelt sermons, uplifting gospel performances, or acts of service, our mission remains the same: to inspire, uplift, and bring people closer to God.</p>
